This repository contains a presenation that did called:

"Understanding the Underlying Patterns of MVC"

It uses the jQuery Presentation Plugin by Trevor Davis for the slides and borrows images from the Head First: Design Patterns book. All images belong to their respective owners.

To explain the strategy pattern which I was having a hard time visualizing I wrote a "Robot Fight" program.

If you would like to see it in action you can installed the code on your own ColdFusion server or http://cfmumbojumbo.com/cf/codedemos/robotstrategy/robotDemo.cfm
